## Introduction

This project is designed to showcase data analysis and visualization skills using Python. It utilizes popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:

- Load and preprocess datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Create insightful visualizations.
- Highlight patterns and trends within the data.

The notebook format allows step-by-step execution and explanations, making it accessible to beginners and professionals alike.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key insights and trends.
- **Visualizations**: Generating meaningful charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Easily adapt the notebook to analyze your own datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pyt_project.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to execute the analysis.
3. Modify the dataset path or parameters as needed to customize the analysis.
